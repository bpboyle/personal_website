I received my PhD in Politics from the University of Strathclyde in 2021. My current research examines political campaigning on Twitter during European Parliament elections, as well as political representation in UK public broadcasting. My other published work based on my PhD research explores the relationship between electoral rules such as compulsory voting and voter registration, and social inequalities across voting, non-electoral participation, and political attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualisation\n\n\n\n    \n    BBC Question Time Tweets on days episodes aired \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Language breakdown of 2019 MEP candidate Tweets\n   \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Brexit views for BBCQT guest appearances (2015-19)\n  \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      Gender balance of BBCQT appearances (1979-2019)\n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n     \n     \n    \n    Brexit vote choice for BBCQT appearances (2015-19)"
