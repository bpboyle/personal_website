    "section": "",
    "text": "The issue of unequal electoral turnout poses serious concerns for both the overall health of democratic politics, and the extent to which certain groups exert an unequal influence on the political process. This article explores the relationship between electoral rules such as: compulsory voting, electoral system proportionality, and voter registration with voter inequality in terms of age, income and education. This is examined using cross-national survey data and cross-level interactions between electoral institutions and socio-demographic variables. The final dataset is based on waves 2–4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and contains information on 133,000 individuals, within 45 countries, between 2001 and 2016. The results indicate that compulsory voting is associated with a significant reduction in turnout inequalities, while the effects of proportionality and voter registration are somewhat more mixed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article measures policy relevance in the abstracts of papers published between 2010 and 2023 in the top 100 journals covering energy research. Communicating the impact of research beyond academia is key to overcoming the evidence-policy divide. Yet, policy engagement is shaped by structural factors and poses unresolved dilemmas for researchers. Qualitative analyses of how research findings are presented in publications are inherently limited in scope, while simple search queries miss contributions that do not refer to ‘policy’ explicitly. Undertaking a large-scale bibliometric analysis, we use computational methods to evaluate over 270,000 abstracts by applying a carefully validated keyword-based dictionary approach. Overall, we find that 15 % of abstracts contain policy-relevant statements, with considerable differences among journals mentioning policy in their aims and scope. We also observe geographic variation by authorship and the funding agencies that sponsored research projects. Finally, we apply unsupervised topic models to identify distinct themes in policy-relevant abstracts. Our analysis reveals that the topics of renewable energy and implementation are most prevalent but have declined since 2010, while the focus on energy systems and emissions has gradually increased. These findings inform ongoing discussions about bridging the gap between research and policy impact in a field that will play a pivotal role in developing pathways to net zero."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Televised political debate programming plays a key function in enabling citizens to become informed of salient political topics, and provides information on parties’ stances on key issues outside of election campaigns. Public broadcasters are bound by strict guidelines to ensure balance in representing different demographic and political groups, to better reflect the distribution of these characteristics within the public and political elites. How are these decisions affected when the biggest political issues of the day create further cleavages that cross-cut existing divides, but also deserve representation in political discourse? In this paper, we examine how panel selection on BBC Question Time dealt with this in relation to two major issues in 21st century UK politics: Brexit and the UK invasion of Iraq. We introduce an original dataset including all BBC Question Time appearances between 2001-2019, created using a combination of web-scraping and expert coding. This allows us to trace patterns in representation across gender, ethnicity, and educational background; as well as partisan affiliation and stances on Brexit and the Iraq war for the show’s panelists. We find that panel selection closely reflects gender and ethnic diversity among the UK public and MPs, but that individuals from privileged educational backgrounds are vastly overrepresented on the show. For both the Iraq war and Brexit, the show again broadly reflects the views of the public and political elites once we account for relevant comparisons between politicians and non-political guests."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Access to social rights is crucial to refugee settlement and integration, and a whole range of social policy measures determine the limits on those rights. In the United Kingdom (UK) various relevant social policies are divided into devolved and reserved categories. This has resulted in a distinct territorial variance in social rights and welfare provisions within the country. The aim of this article is to explore how young Syrian refugees experience this territorial divergence in two jurisdictions: in Scotland, where they are part social citizens; and in England, where access to social rights is more limited. We use the prism of social citizenship as a means of examining the experiences of settlement and integration of Syrian refugees in the two nations. We draw out contrasts between these experiences and locate them within the interactions between the politics of welfare and refugee politics in the two nations. We argue that fine variances in England’s and Scotland’s social rights and welfare regimes have an impact on the settlement experiences of refugees. England’s less supportive regime fosters self-reliance and faster labour market integration among refugees. However, this environment pushes refugees in England to accept any job that they might find, no matter how precarious, or how far it may be from their educational qualifications, past professional experience or aspirations. This has overarching implications for refugees’ outlook on life and long-term planning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It has long been assumed that social media would equalize election campaigning by providing cheap means of communication for smaller parties who lack a strong mass media presence. Yet given the increased political importance of social media, parties with more professional staff and resources could also gain the upper hand in online campaigns. So far, knowledge of the development of online campaigning in a rapidly changing political landscape remains limited, as only few studies have taken a longitudinal and cross-country approach so far. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of more than 12,000 unique candidates from all 28 European Union (EU) member states in the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections. We theorize and empirically assess how party size, the populist nature of parties and their EU position relate to the presence and activity of EP candidates on Twitter as well as the salience of the EU in their tweets. The results show that candidates of parties with a bigger national vote share were more likely to have a Twitter account and tweet more on the EU. Overall, the findings point to a normalization of online election campaigning over time and a further convergence of first and second-order elections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "EU environmental policy is one of the success stories of European integration. In this paper, we argue that popular support for EU-cantered environmental protection efforts has helped underpin the case for the legitimacy of this transnational body. By analysing how European political parties frame the relationship between European integration and Green politics during the European Parliament (EP) elections, we aim to show the degree to which the Green Agenda can be used to (re)build consensus around European integration. We make use of Twitter data from all MEP candidates during the 2019 EP election campaign. Combining human coding and machine learning techniques, we identify the issue(s) in a given tweet, as well as the degree to which it expresses support for EU integration. We contrast the level of support for the EU in relation to environmental issues (embedded), with more general expressions of support for the EU among candidates. We report promising evidence to suggest that dominant mainstream parties and Green parties are generally promoting this embedded framing and that this framing has been rewarded with members of the public being more likely to re-tweet pro-integration messaging when linked to the environment."
