    "section": "",
    "text": "The issue of unequal electoral turnout poses serious concerns for both the overall health of democratic politics, and the extent to which certain groups exert an unequal influence on the political process. This article explores the relationship between electoral rules such as: compulsory voting, electoral system proportionality, and voter registration with voter inequality in terms of age, income and education. This is examined using cross-national survey data and cross-level interactions between electoral institutions and socio-demographic variables. The final dataset is based on waves 2–4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and contains information on 133,000 individuals, within 45 countries, between 2001 and 2016. The results indicate that compulsory voting is associated with a significant reduction in turnout inequalities, while the effects of proportionality and voter registration are somewhat more mixed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Access to social rights is crucial to refugee settlement and integration, and a whole range of social policy measures determine the limits on those rights. In the United Kingdom (UK) various relevant social policies are divided into devolved and reserved categories. This has resulted in a distinct territorial variance in social rights and welfare provisions within the country. The aim of this article is to explore how young Syrian refugees experience this territorial divergence in two jurisdictions: in Scotland, where they are part social citizens; and in England, where access to social rights is more limited. We use the prism of social citizenship as a means of examining the experiences of settlement and integration of Syrian refugees in the two nations. We draw out contrasts between these experiences and locate them within the interactions between the politics of welfare and refugee politics in the two nations. We argue that fine variances in England's and Scotland's social rights and welfare regimes have an impact on the settlement experiences of refugees. England's less supportive regime fosters self-reliance and faster labour market integration among refugees. However, this environment pushes refugees in England to accept any job that they might find, no matter how precarious, or how far it may be from their educational qualifications, past professional experience or aspirations. This has overarching implications for refugees' outlook on life and long-term planning."

Effective communication in areas like climate change and net zero energy is crucial for societal engagement and policy adoption. This study maps the prevalence of policy recommendations in academic research on renewable energy and climate change. We use a fine-tuned transformer-based machine learning classifier to analyze abstracts from over 355,000 publications to identify policy recommendations. We find that fewer than one in ten abstracts make a policy recommendation, with notable differences across disciplines and topics. Recommendations have become more common in climate change research, although the increase in net zero energy systems research is less pronounced. Our study suggests that policymakers and advisors may rarely find practical implications in research abstracts. Therefore, researchers and practitioners should explicitly state the policy relevance of their work in abstracts or use supplementary communication channels to discuss how science can contribute to a net zero energy future and climate change mitigation."

We argue that the policy salience and policy positions that MEPs signalled during their electoral campaign align with voting behaviour during the parliamentary term. Specifically, we anticipate that MEPs will be less likely to abstain or be absent from legislative proposals that match the policy domain they emphasized during their campaign. Furthermore, we expect that MEPs who expressed Eurosceptic views in their campaign communication will be more likely to oppose the EU authority expansion. We test our expectations using a novel dataset of MEPs’ policy statements on Twitter posted during the 2019 EP election campaign. For all EU countries and languages, policy content and positions have been extracted using human coding and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning. We merge this with the Vote Watch data and a scaled indicator of EU authority expansion. Relying on all EU countries, we provide comparative evidence for the consistency between campaign and legislative behaviour alignment, with substantial variation along party discipline and individual reelection motivations"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Televised political debate programming plays a key function in enabling citizens to become informed of salient political topics, and provides information on parties’ stances on key issues outside of election campaigns. Public broadcasters are bound by strict guidelines to ensure balance in representing different demographic and political groups, to better reflect the distribution of these characteristics within the public and political elites. How are these decisions affected when the biggest political issues of the day create further cleavages that cross-cut existing divides, but also deserve representation in political discourse? In this paper, we examine how panel selection on BBC Question Time dealt with this in relation to two major issues in 21st century UK politics: Brexit and the UK invasion of Iraq. We introduce an original dataset including all BBC Question Time appearances between 2001-2019, created using a combination of web-scraping and expert coding. This allows us to trace patterns in representation across gender, ethnicity, and educational background; as well as partisan affiliation and stances on Brexit and the Iraq war for the show’s panelists. We find that panel selection closely reflects gender and ethnic diversity among the UK public and MPs, but that individuals from privileged educational backgrounds are vastly overrepresented on the show. For both the Iraq war and Brexit, the show again broadly reflects the views of the public and political elites once we account for relevant comparisons between politicians and non-political guests."

    "text": "It has long been assumed that social media would equalize election campaigning by providing cheap means of communication for smaller parties who lack a strong mass media presence. Yet given the increased political importance of social media, parties with more professional staff and resources could also gain the upper hand in online campaigns. So far, knowledge of the development of online campaigning in a rapidly changing political landscape remains limited, as only few studies have taken a longitudinal and cross-country approach so far. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of more than 12,000 unique candidates from all 28 European Union (EU) member states in the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections. We theorize and empirically assess how party size, the populist nature of parties and their EU position relate to the presence and activity of EP candidates on Twitter as well as the salience of the EU in their tweets. The results show that candidates of parties with a bigger national vote share were more likely to have a Twitter account and tweet more on the EU. Overall, the findings point to a ``normalization’’ of online election campaigning over time and a further convergence of first and second-order elections."
