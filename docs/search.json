I received my PhD in Politics from the University of Strathclyde in 2021. My current research examines political campaigning on Twitter during European Parliament elections, as well as political representation in UK public broadcasting. My other published work based on my PhD research explores the relationship between electoral rules such as compulsory voting and voter registration, and social inequalities across voting, non-electoral participation, and political attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualisation\n\n\n\n    \n    BBC Question Time Tweets on days episodes aired \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Language breakdown of 2019 MEP candidate Tweets\n   \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Brexit views for BBCQT guest appearances (2015-19)\n  \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      Gender balance of BBCQT appearances (1979-2019)\n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n     \n     \n    \n    Brexit vote choice for BBCQT appearances (2015-19)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The issue of unequal electoral turnout poses serious concerns for both the overall health of democratic politics, and the extent to which certain groups exert an unequal influence on the political process. This article explores the relationship between electoral rules such as: compulsory voting, electoral system proportionality, and voter registration with voter inequality in terms of age, income and education. This is examined using cross-national survey data and cross-level interactions between electoral institutions and socio-demographic variables. The final dataset is based on waves 2–4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and contains information on 133,000 individuals, within 45 countries, between 2001 and 2016. The results indicate that compulsory voting is associated with a significant reduction in turnout inequalities, while the effects of proportionality and voter registration are somewhat more mixed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Access to social rights is crucial to refugee settlement and integration, and a whole range of social policy measures determine the limits on those rights. In the United Kingdom (UK) various relevant social policies are divided into devolved and reserved categories. This has resulted in a distinct territorial variance in social rights and welfare provisions within the country. The aim of this article is to explore how young Syrian refugees experience this territorial divergence in two jurisdictions: in Scotland, where they are part social citizens; and in England, where access to social rights is more limited. We use the prism of social citizenship as a means of examining the experiences of settlement and integration of Syrian refugees in the two nations. We draw out contrasts between these experiences and locate them within the interactions between the politics of welfare and refugee politics in the two nations. We argue that fine variances in England's and Scotland's social rights and welfare regimes have an impact on the settlement experiences of refugees. England's less supportive regime fosters self-reliance and faster labour market integration among refugees. However, this environment pushes refugees in England to accept any job that they might find, no matter how precarious, or how far it may be from their educational qualifications, past professional experience or aspirations. This has overarching implications for refugees' outlook on life and long-term planning."
