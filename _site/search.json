I received my PhD in Politics from the University of Strathclyde in 2021. My current research examines political campaigning on Twitter during European Parliament elections, as well as political representation in UK public broadcasting. My other published work based on my PhD research explores the relationship between electoral rules such as compulsory voting and voter registration, and social inequalities across voting, non-electoral participation, and political attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualisation\n\n\n\n    \n    BBC Question Time Tweets on days episodes aired \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Language breakdown of 2019 MEP candidate Tweets\n   \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n\n    \n    Brexit views for BBCQT guest appearances (2015-19)\n  \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      Gender balance of BBCQT appearances (1979-2019)\n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n     \n     \n    \n    Brexit vote choice for BBCQT appearances (2015-19)"

    "text": "The Languages of Middle-earth\n\narXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "The issue of unequal electoral turnout poses serious concerns for both the overall health of democratic politics, and the extent to which certain groups exert an unequal influence on the political process. This article explores the relationship between electoral rules such as: compulsory voting, electoral system proportionality, and voter registration with voter inequality in terms of age, income and education. This is examined using cross-national survey data and cross-level interactions between electoral institutions and socio-demographic variables. The final dataset is based on waves 2–4 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, and contains information on 133,000 individuals, within 45 countries, between 2001 and 2016. The results indicate that compulsory voting is associated with a significant reduction in turnout inequalities, while the effects of proportionality and voter registration are somewhat more mixed."

    "text": "Abstract\nAnalysts often transform their models’ parameter estimates to report more meaningful and interpretable quantities of interest. This article presents a simple conceptual framework to describe a vast array of estimands which are reported under imprecise and inconsistent terminology across disciplines: predictions, marginal predictions, marginal means, marginal effects, conditional effects, slopes, contrasts, risk ratios, etc. We introduce marginaleffects, an R package which offers a simple and powerful interface to compute all of those quantites, and to conduct hypothesis tests on them. marginaleffects is lightweight; extensible; it works well in combination with other R packages; and it supports over 70 classes of models, including Generalized Linear, Generalized Additive, Mixed Effects, and Bayesian models."
